        <li>
            <h2>Medivh</h2>
        </li>
        <div style="margin-left:32px">
            
            <li>Arcane Rift now does 1 damage (down from 208).  Can be increased to 416 damage if he completes The Master's Touch.</li>
            <li>Force of Will now sheilds for 0.01 seconds (down from 1.5 seconds).</li>
            <li>Portal removed - replaced with Summon Confetti: Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The Master's Touch now requires 150 charges, and causes Medivh to take 100% increased damage.  Moved to baseline.</li>
        </div>
        <!--/li-->
        <li>
            <h2>Chromie</h2>
        </li>
            <div style="margin-left:32px">
                <li>Damage dealt from all sources increased by 250%.  If the Chromie is too bad to hit any abilities, at least she will have a pretty sweet auto-attack.</li>
            </div>
        <li><h2>Abathur</h2></li>
        <div style="margin-left:32px">
            <li>Health increased to 4500 (up from 500).</li>
            <li>Auto-attack damage increased to 260 (up from 26).</li>
            <li>Ultimate Evolution moved to baseline.  Now reads: Abathur turns into a literal god, increases his movement speed by 100%, reduces damage taken to 50% and increases damage done by Auto-Attacks by 150%.</li>
